I've been really enjoying working with Claude lately!!! Apps I worked on for years and never finished I'm launching in a matter of weeks. These are all still works in progress, but Frunk and  Cleanroom are webapps, ThemeForseen is a library on NPM and Xun is a desktop app. Xun and Cleanroom especially are only about halfway done. Frunk is in a working, usable state and ThemeForseen is starting to be fairly robust. I have working merch stores on Frunk, Clearnroom and ThemeForseen and have ordered stickers and hoodies just to test and they've arrived and are awesome.

I've been working with a fairly involved set of instructions for Claude. `CLAUDE.md`  is symlinked to a context file, which in turn points to some files defining subagents with various tasks. I use the Context7 and Playwright MCP servers for up-to-date syntax and TDD, respectively. On some of the apps, I have `main`  blocked until tests run and pass on the pull requests.
