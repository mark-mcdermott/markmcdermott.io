This blog has answers for the following scenario. I'm on a local dev branch and have committed my changes. I want to see:
- filenames that have changes from master (local)
- diffs of all files that have changes from master (local)
- filenames that have changes from origin/master (remote)
- diffs of all files that have changes from origin/master (remote)

## Filenames With Changes (local)
```
git diff --name-only master
```

## Diffs of Files With Changes (local)
```
git diff master
```

## Filenames With Changes (remote)
```
git fetch origin master
git diff --name-only origin/master
```

## Diffs of Files With Changes (remote)
```
git fetch origin master
git diff origin/master
```

## Bonus: Compact Change Summary
```
git diff --stat master         # local  
git diff --stat origin/master  # remote (git fetch origin master first)
```
