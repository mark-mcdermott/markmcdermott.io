Yesterday I ran into an issue where I committed some changes locally in git and then wished I hadn't. And I realized my last post about git, my Git Cheatsheet, didn't have how to undo the last local commit. Turns out it's one of the easiest things to do in git: `git reset HEAD~`. It *just works*. All files committed in the last commit will now show as unstaged with modifications, just like they were before you committed.

Of course, nothing with git is ever this simple. git reset has `soft`, `mixed` and `hard` options. When we omit those options, it defaults to `mixed`, which means unstage changes made after the last commit. `soft` means unstage everything. `hard` means ignore everything, which of course is destructive.
