Today in Rails I wanted to find out if there was a one-liner that would delete multiple items by id in the Rails console. Turns out there is: 
```
User.where(id: [1,2,3]).each(&:destroy)
```
The `&:` is apparently Ruby shorthand for passing a method as a block and the above expands to:
```
User.find([1,2,3]).each { |record| record.destroy }
```
