`gh auth` is a really nice way to access your Github repos from the command line. But it has always confused me a little bit. I believe there are [three ways] you can auth with `gh auth`:
- with an 1) environment variable or 2) stored token
	1) I believe if `gh auth` is run without the `--with-token` flag, it first checks for an environment variable (can be `GH_TOKEN` or `GITHUB_TOKEN`). If found, it uses that
	2) If no environment variable is found, it looks for a Github token stored credentials (Keychain (mac), `libsecret` (Linux) or Credential Manager (Windows)). If found, it uses that.
- `gh auth login`  (with no environment variable set and no stored token set)
	- uses the default method, web-based, which is really convenient
	- stores an auth token in the system credentials store
- `gh auth login --with-token`
	- you can pass in a classic personal access token (must have `repo, read:org and gist`) in standard input
	- you can also pass in an environment variable here if you like with `echo $GH_TOKEN | gh auth login --with-token`
