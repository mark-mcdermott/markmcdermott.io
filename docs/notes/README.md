# Learning Notes

This directory contains student-perspective notes created during learning sessions.

## Purpose
- Reinforce learning through active note-taking
- Create a personal reference for review
- Track "aha" moments and mental models
- Document misconceptions that were corrected

## Structure
Notes mirror the curriculum sections:
```
notes/
|-- 01-understanding-astro/
|   |-- 01-astro-fundamentals.md
|   |-- 02-content-collections.md
|-- 02-css-scss-mastery/

|   |-- 02-layout-systems.md
|-- 03-web-fundamentals/
|   |-- 01-javascript-essentials.md
|-- ...
```

## Note Format
Each note should include:
- Date and session focus
- Key insights ("This clicked when...")
- Mental models (diagrams, analogies)
- Misconceptions corrected
- Connection to QA experience
- Questions for later
- What I'm ready for next

## Voice
Write from your own perspective: "I learned...", "This clicked when...", "I was wrong about..."
